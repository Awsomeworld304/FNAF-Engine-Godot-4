# FNAF Engine for Godot 4.x (4.2.1)
This is an engine meant for beginer developers to start in Godot with FNaF games in mind.\
Do not use this if you are looking for a shortcut, this is not for you.\
But instead, if you're willing to put in the effort, this will help you along the way.\
Alright with that out of the way, let's get started shall we?
## Build Instructions
First, start by cloning the repo via 'git clone' in your terminal (or cmd of you're on Windows.')\
Next, import the project in Godots project manager.\
You should be able to open the project.\
Try building via the play button in the top right to start the game from the start.\
If it works, then congrats! Godot works and so does the project.\
### Exporting
Exporting is a bit tougher. It's better to follow [Godot's Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html) for this one.
